        <p> Hey my name is Afroze Khan and I've been a tech guy since my early teens. I picked up graphic design in high school, all thanks to a very fun and exciting marketing class. From there new avenues opened up for me and my journey began. After spending a couple of years doing graphic design I decided to choose web programming as my specialization in college. This introduced me to a whole new world of languages, frameworks and tools for me to learn and bring my designs to life. I am constantly learning new technologies and building upon my skills, which is really rewarding and gives me a great sense of empowerment. Check out my skillset page to see what I've learned so far!
